If the number of messages in the queue is extremely\nsmall, you might not receive any messages in a particular `ReceiveMessage`\nresponse; in which case you should repeat the request.\nFor each message returned, the response includes the following:\n  * Message body\n  * MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, go to <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html>.\n  * Message ID you received when you sent the message to the queue.\n  * Receipt handle.\n  * Message attributes.\n  * MD5 digest of the message attributes.\nThe receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the\nmessage. For more information, see [Queue and Message Identifiers](http://docs\n.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/ImportantIdenti\nfiers.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.\nYou can provide the `VisibilityTimeout` parameter in your request, which will\nbe applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you do\nnot include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is\nused for the returned messages. For more information, see [Visibility Timeout]\n(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/Abo\nutVT.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.\nGoing forward, new attributes might be added. If you are writing code that\ncalls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can\nhandle new attributes gracefully.",63,{"inputs":[{"name":"sqsclient"},{"name":"receivemessagerequest"}],"output":{"name":"result"}}],[11,"delete_message","","Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. You specify the\nmessage by using the message's `receipt handle` and not the `message ID` you\nreceived when you sent the message. Even if the message is locked by another\nreader due to the visibility timeout setting, it is still deleted from the\nqueue. If you leave a message in the queue for longer than the queue's\nconfigured retention period, Amazon SQS automatically deletes it.\nThe receipt handle is associated with a specific instance of receiving the\nmessage. If you receive a message more than once, the receipt handle you get\neach time you receive the message is different. When you request\n`DeleteMessage`, if you don't provide the most recently received receipt\nhandle for the message, the request will still succeed, but the message might\nnot be deleted.\nIt is possible you will receive a message even after you have deleted it. This\nmight happen on rare occasions if one of the servers storing a copy of the\nmessage is unavailable when you request to delete the message. The copy\nremains on the server and might be returned to you again on a subsequent\nreceive request.
